			<p>Our classes and certificate programs are designed to prepare students to work in entry level public health social services settings with a focus on HIV, STIs, Hepatitis and TB.</p>

			<h3>Certificate in Infectious Disease Prevention in Priority Populations</h3>
			<p>Our certificate program reflects the emerging area of front line community health training in infectious disease prevention and management; primarily HIV, STI's, Hepatitis and TB. The 11-unit program of study prepares diverse entry-level workers in a variety of community-based public health, health care, and social service settings that address infectious disease prevention and management. Skill sets in the certificate include case management, outreach, client navigation & linkage, and counseling-motivational interviewing.</p>

			<h3>Health 67: Systems of Prevention for HIV & Other Infectious Disease</h3>
			<p>Health 67 is a core foundational class in the new certificate program. It is offered every semester. Students are strongly encouraged to take Health 67 before other coursework. Health 67 provides education and skills training to help diverse populations to reduce their risk of infection for HIV, STI's, Hepatitis, and TB. Health 67 meets CCSF graduation requirements in Areas G2 and H3.</p>
